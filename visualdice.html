        <p>This is where your dice will display when rolled; each die will be contained within its own div and when user clicks it, that one will be removed from "hand" and the process of rolling will be implemented again for that single die.</p>
        <p>To re-roll all the dice, click the button "roll" above to remove all these dice from the "hand" and roll an entirely new set</p>

<!-- The dice should appear visually as dice, although for testing you can just 
    start with numbers. Come up with any reasonable way to display the visual dice.
At the bottom of the screen, show the sum of all the dice currently out. -->
