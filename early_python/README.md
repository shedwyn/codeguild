# Early Python

*The Python work was started before we learned about importing modules and using Git and I had to rename the first dozen or more because they began with numbers.  Therefore, some may be out of order right now.  Some of these projects are unfinished due to the speed we whipped through them.  I hope to finish the ones that interest me over time.*
