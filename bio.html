        <h2>History:</h2>
        <h3>Early Years:</h3>
        <p class="biotext">I was born outside Salem, OR to parents Ralph D. (teacher/network admin) and Patricia A. Fough(bookkeeper/librarian).  Raised in rural area to parents in middle class jobs within a farming community, there were noticeable but unacknowledged conflicts between the liberal middle-class values I was learning at home (thanks both to my parents and television) and the more conservative values of those working-class farmers, farm-workers, and unemployed residents of our rural community. There was a lot of poverty around me and that was my norm.  Our family made what would be considered in a city to be a lower middle class income, or even poorer working class, but for our area, it placed me solidly in the middle class.  My father enjoyed long road trips which were often accomplished thanks to our beloved faded turquoise green '69 Chevy snub nosed van with custom built platform crate in the back that would be completely illegal in today's environment (no seats, let alone seatbelts).  He always loved to take the road less traveled, even when it involved a 300 point turnaround when the road ended with a boulder on a narrow cliff.</p>
        <p class="biotext">Academically, I prefered art and theatre to all other subjects.  I gravitated toward "outsiders" at school, favored black clothing, heavy eye liner, and hair <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberty_spikes">styled</a> with large quantities of hair cement.  I moved at age 16 from our rural community to Salem, OR for Junior year of high school, which resulted in astonishing increase in GPA from the 2 point range to upper 3 point range</p>
        <h3>College Years:</h3>
        <p class="biotext">My first major mistake:  choosing to stay close to home and study theatre at <a target="_blank" href="https://www.lclark.edu/">Lewis & Clark College</a> in Portland, OR.  In retrospect, this was my best opportunity to get out of Oregon and explore living in other parts of the country.  I was able to do this later in life, but with much more effort.</p>
        <p class="biotext">Once in college, I had my first opportunity for cross-nation travel when I went to NYC as a part of LC's "overseas" programming.  Interned at Mabou Mines Theatre group in split internship shared between office manager and stage manager.</p>  
        <p class="biotext">First thing learned:  Artistic directors can be stubborn, idealistic, intransigent, and incapable of incorporating financial reality with artistic dreams.</p>  
        <p class="biotext">Second thing learned:  Theatre was not the appropriate major to study.  Unfortunately, she had reached the 2nd trimester of her Junior year when she began to realize this and instead of trying to change majors, she powered through graduating with a less than idea GPA.</p>  
        <p class="biotext">Final thing learned:  Acting/theatre skills translate pretty well to the workplace if you know how to phrase things</p>
