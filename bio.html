        <h3>Early Years:</h3>

            <div>
                <p>I was born in Stayton, OR to Ralph D. (teacher/network admin) and Patricia A. Fough (bookkeeper/librarian).  Raised in a rural area to aspiring middle-class parents, there were noticeable but unacknowledged conflicts between the liberal middle-class values I was learning at home (thanks to parents <em>and</em> television) and the more conservative values of those working-class farmers and cannery workers. As a child I was unaware that what many of my friends were experiencing was rural poverty.  Drugs, domestic violence, child abuse, high unemployment, and racism surrounded me but somehow I was either unaware of or shielded from them.</p>
                <p>Thanks largely to my father's love of driving, we took a long road trip to Nevada by a new route every summer and shorter road trips peppered our weekends throughout the year.  Most often these trips were taken in what would now be considered a "death-trap" - our beloved faded tourqoise '69 Chevy Van. It is thanks to my father that I love road trips and long scenic drives.  I aspired to be neither an accountant nor a network administrator, but spent my energy on art and drama classes.  When our family moved to Salem in my Junior year, I was able to flourish surrounded by more like-minded individuals.</p>

            <h3>Adulthood:</h3>
            <p>In retrospect, deciding to attend a local college, <a target="_blank" href="https://www.lclark.edu/">Lewis & Clark College</a>, was a mistake.  I received an excellent education, but going away for college is any young person's best opportunity to experience not just another physical location, but other attitudes and cultures.  I did well enough, graduating with a 3.67, but never found my niche, certainly not with theatre.</p>  
            <p>In the years since college, I managed to take a 6 week trip to Italy in 1995.  It was exciting and, yes, I traveled completely alone.  There were moments of lonliness, but there was also incredible freedom.  I followed that many years later with a trip to Ireland with a friend, only a week that time.  I did move to Chicago and finally got to experience living and working in a large city without the same safety net I had in NYC.  I was really a Chicagoan.  I left Chicago in 2009 because of the economy and when I did, I left a piece of my heart behind.  I landed in the Denver metro area.  Someday, I want to travel to India for at least 3 weeks, then backback in Peru and take a bird watching tour up the Amazon by boat, go on safari in Africa, revisit parts of Italy, see Denali, see Alaska...the list is endless.</p>
            <p>But although I was scratching my itchy feet, my mind has never been satisfied, which is, I suppose, how I ended up in code school.</p>
