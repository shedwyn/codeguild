**Distasteful, not bias, contributes to exclusion**
    * loudly discussing code issues so that everyone is forced to hear their discussion.  
    * why distasteful?  disruptive and seemingly boastful.  "I am so proud of myself that I
    am going to force all of you to listen to me.  Because I think what I have to say is so
    useful, interesting, and talented that all of you SHOULD be listending to me.  If you 
    do not like it, tough.  You are clearly a worm unable to understand what I am saying
    which is very important, relevant, and amazing - so much so, that you owe it to me to
    stop what you are doing and listen.  I reserve the right to disrupt YOUR work with MY
    code discussion because surely what I am doing is more interesting and exciting than
    whatever crap you are doing.  If you cannot be bothered to listen to me, then put on
    your headphones and change YOUR work environment to accomodate ME and WHAT I WANT."
    * So, by thrusting (forcefully, may I say) his views out at us and demanding that we
    listen to him, he is showing a disregard for the importance of whatever we may be doing.
    * audio rape - being forced to listen to a bombastic man, who feels he has finally found
    his throne and worshipful audience, walk through the steps of getting a particular
    part of his code to function. Rather than limit his discussion to the person next to him
    who is interested, he is passive aggressively forcing the whole room to participate.
    * but when I have felt left out of these discussions previously, why would I not welcome
    this opportunity to chime in and follow along?
        * difference, I still was not invited, nor is it likely to be a discussion, rather
        a one-side lecture.  I am supposed to be the apt student and listen.  Or, even if I 
        have something to say, it better be useful TO HIM or it will be dismissed.
        * because it is loud and means I have to share my thoughts and ideas with the whole 
        room in order to participate rather than just share one-on-one.  therefore, if I am 
        not as boastfully confident (it amazes me how confident he is when he says "I copied 
        this cool code from on-line and look what it does.  No, I have no idea how it works
        but it got my program to function, so I used it") of what I have to say, well, time 
        to put my non-existant balls on the table for a sniffing contest anyway.  Whoever has
        the stinkiest wins.
        * there is nothing inclusive about a shouting conversation at the end of the table when
        others are quietly working.  It is meant to show how fun, smart, and energized I am.  It
        is strictly boastful.  I don't want to participate in a pissing contest that is disguised
        as a fire suppression activity.
    * I find him to be a distasteful person.  Why am I not angry with the other participant?  For one
    he is keeping his voice a bit lower (still could lower more).  He is doing nothing to encourage
    the bombast to lower his voice.
    ** Conclusion:  Yes, distastful, but largely because I do not like this person, so this is probably
    more motivated by personal dislike, even if it is rude.**
