Dear _____:

You are receiving this "form" letter from me because it seemed like a smart
thing to do.  Why 'smart'?  Because identify potential 'allies' is one of the
first things a woman is advised to do at a new tech job.  Having male allies
is useful to a woman for many reason.  Allies, of course, are working to bridge
the gender gap - whether they do it for idealogical reasons or because they
know their company will produce better products with a more diverse workforce
or a combination of the two - which helps, but on a personal level, allies give
women more voice.  Allies, just by being there, reaching out, pulling women up,
inviting their voices to the table, lending support, encouraging, providing a
bridge over the crevasse that too often separates a woman from leadership roles
