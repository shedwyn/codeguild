Was Any of the Subject Matter Potentially Exclusive or Offensive
        - share even if you were not personally offended
        - the purpose of this question is not to find ammunition to impose stringent 
        "PC guidelines" on the office/classroom, but to take statistics and use them 
        as a discussion tool for improving our level of inclusivity.  It would be a 
        poor workplace/classroom that did not allow you to discuss personal matters
        and controversial subjects, but we want to balance freedom of speech with the
        rights of individuals to work/study without feeling excluded or targeted by 
        hateful speech
