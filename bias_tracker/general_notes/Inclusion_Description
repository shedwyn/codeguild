We encourage you to praise your collegues who make you (or others) feel included 
in interactions, who speak up when they see exclusion happening, who make
a point to include those who are being excluded, who are willing to 
openly, fairly, and appropriately discuss the challenges and opportunities
in ensuring a work/school culture is inclusive.
